# Cypress Recorder

![](src/images/recorder.png)
Cypress recorder is a Chrome extension that records your browser interactions and generates a
[Cypress-io](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress) script. Install it from the [Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/puppeteer-recorder/djeegiggegleadkkbgopoonhjimgehda).
This project is pretty fresh, but does the following already:

- Records clicks and type events.
- Add setViewPort and other useful clauses.
- Generates a Cypress script.
- Shows which events are being recorded.
- Copy to clipboard.
- Offers configuration options.
- Allows data-id configuration for element selection.

> Note: we only record clicks etc. on a handful of elements, see the `elements-to-bind-to.js` and `dom-events-to-record.js` files in the code-generator folder for which events. This collection will be expanded in future releases.

## Usage

- Click the icon and hit Record.
- Hit <kbd>tab</kbd> after you finish typing in an `input` element.
- Click links, inputs and other elements.
- Wait for full page load on each navigation. The icon will switch from ![](src/images/icon_rec.png) to ![](src/images/icon_wait.png).
- Click Pause when you want to navigate without recording anything. Hit Resume to continue recording.

## Background

Writing Cypress scripts for scraping, testing and monitoring can be tricky. A recorder / code generator can be helpful,
even if the code isn't perfect. This project builds on other projects (see [disclaimer](#user-content-credits--disclaimer)
below) but add extensibility, configurability and a smoother UI.

## Development

1.  Run: `git clone https://github.com/raodurgesh/cypress-recorder-server-sync.git`
2.  Build the project: `cd cypress-recorder && npm i && npm run dev`
3.  Navigate to chrome://extensions
4.  Make sure 'Developer mode' is checked
5.  Click Load unpacked extension...
6.  Browse to cypress-recorder/build and click Select

## Credits & disclaimer

Cypress recorder is a slightly code customization for cypres.io base on the excelent work of
[Puppeteer recorder](https://github.com/checkly/puppeteer-recorder).
